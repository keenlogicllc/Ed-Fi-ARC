The Ed-Fi API Record Counter (Ed-Fi ARC), created by KeenLogic, is designed to efficiently tally the number of records within any given endpoint of an individual's Ed-Fi API. This utility is tailored to provide end-users with a comprehensive overview of the API's data volume, without the need for in-depth SQL or programming knowledge. Ed-Fi ARC ensures accessibility to essential data metrics while adhering to the principle of least privilege, preventing exposure to sensitive information. It enables a straightforward method for users to quickly understand the extent of data available through the Ed-Fi API, facilitating access in a non-invasive and user-friendly manner.

Currently, Ed-Fi ARC has undergone testing with Ed-Fi API versions 6.2 and 7.1. Compatibility with earlier versions of the Ed-Fi API is in development and expected to be introduced in future updates.
